This year, for the first time, I participated in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), a 25-day set of small coding puzzles/challenges. You're free to approach them most-any way you want, so I used my existing Python knowledge, though tried to build things out a bit.

Anyway, my final "score" was:

And you can find how I did everything at: [repolink](repolink)

## General thoughts
The puzzles were mostly fun, and reminded me of various Zachtronics games (albeit with way more resources on-hand and fewer targets for the leaderboard). I probably need to build out my skills a lot, since I generally took an hour or two per puzzle, while most people needed <30 minutes. I also need to better generalize, know what tools I have on-hand (it's *Python*, I have so many libraries...), and just get better at parsing inputs. Performance (at least to the point of avoiding giant arrays), probably also.

## Specific Challenges
