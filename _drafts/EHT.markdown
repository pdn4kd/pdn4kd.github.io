The [Event Horizon Telescope]() is one of the cooler examples of [VLBI](), both in function (directly imaging the black hole at the center of our galaxy), and name. But why that one specifically, and what can be done for comparison?

The reasoning given is clear enough; the event horizon of Sgr A\* has the greatest angular sizeof any black hole. But this also (slightly) hides just how much more difficult other targets are.

# Generalities
(size, mass, and distance considerations)
For the purposes of this, black hole sizes can be approximated by the [Schwartzchild radius](). Technically this isn't the apparent size, but is close enough. Notably both the apparent radius and Schwartzchild radius scale linearly with mass.

The [small angle approximation]() means that apparent size also scales linearly, though with distance instead.

# Sgr A\*
(nominally 8 kpc, 4e6 M_sun, try to find that GR paper from 2018)
(9.87 Î¼arcsec, or 4.785e-11 rad)

# Stellar Black Holes
These are completely impractical. The nearest two ([???](), and [Cygnus X-1]()) are comparatively tiny, with angular sizes of \_, and \_ arcseconds, respectively. All of the stellar ones that we've found so far have been somewhat distant, and [lists]() include ones even farther than Sgr A\*.

Undiscovered ones are almost as impractical. For a 10 M_sun black hole to have the same angular size as Sgr A\*, it would have to be 0.02 pc (4125 au) away. That's inside the [Hills cloud]().

# Other (ie: Extragalacitc) Supermassive Black Holes
This is rather tempting. Afterall, our supermassive black hole is rather weedy. Can a more typical (or unusually heavy) one overcome the enormous distances?

The answer is yes, sort of. For a handful of especially promising galaxies, the apparent event horizon sizes should be at most one order of magnitude smaller than Sgr\*.

(NGC 4889, M 87, M 104, but see SMC, LMC, M 31 for limitations)
