ASTRONOMY 128
	That lab you always wanted to take. Practical/hands-on, with a focus on amature instruments and operations. Also covers some demonstrations of celestial phenomona and professional equipment.

ASTRONOMY 256
	The missing bridge class between introductory ones, and those focused on upper level physics majors and/or grad students. Lots of explanations of how measurement systems, etc work. To some degree an instrumentation class. Also some astrodynamics.

ASTRONOMY 512
	Notes from a graduate class that does not exist. Explores the true horror of fluxes, colors, and magnitudes. Also some computational demonology, er, statistics.

Chabrier, Kroupa, Salpeter IMFs: ?
Estimating masses, luminosities etc from magnitudes and colors: ?
