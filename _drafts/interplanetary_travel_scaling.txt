Inspired by https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03698 even if it's not a very good article. Interstellar travel with practical timescales implies speeds of at least a few percent c, far beyond the escape requirements any plausible star system or the capabilities of chemical rockets.

The luminosity of a main sequence star (especially one that is relatively sunlike) can be approximated with L = M^x. Usually, x is around 4.

Irradiation is of the form S ~ L/a^2, where a is the planet's semi-major axis. Here we want a constant S at around that of Earth's (ignoring that it can be a bit higher for bluer stars and a bit lower for redder stars). So a ~ sqrt(L/S) ~ sqrt(L) = sqrt(M^x)

Orbital period is of the form T^2 ~ a^3/M, so T ~ sqrt(a^3/M). Substituting, T ~ sqrt(M^(3x/2-1)) = M^(3x/4 - 1/2)

For a circular orbit, V ~ sqrt(M/a) = sqrt(M/M^x/2) = M^(1/2-x/4)

So for luminosity scaling faster than M^2, planets orbit faster around lower mass stars/transfer orbits require more Î”V. Year length (and therefore transfer times) will decrease for scaling faster than M^(2/3). So interplanetary travel/space exploration for a civilization around a red dwarf would require larger rockets, but smaller life support systems than our own. The reverse would be true for a civilization around an A star. (Higher mass stars do not live long enough to be relevant.)
