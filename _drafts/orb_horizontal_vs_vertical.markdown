A common KSP newbie question is some form of "why do I want to go sideways instead of up?" The most common reason is that atmospheric drag doesn't matter as much as gravity drag, but sometimes the Oberth effect still means that sideways maneuvers are more efficient. Assume that you're on the surface of a perfectly spherical planet with no atmosphere, and have a rocket with infinite TWR...

Planet gravitational parameter: $$\mu$$
Planet radius: $$r_1$$
Target orbital altitude (with respect to the planet's center): $$r_2$$

# Just altitude?
Getting to an orbit at the surface:
$$\Delta v = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{r_1}}$$

Altitude that you can reach with a given $$\Delta v$$ expendature:
-mu/(0.5v^2-mu/r1) = r2

Expendature for going straight up:
$$\Delta v = \sqrt{2\mu(\frac{1}{r_1}-\frac{1}{r_2}}$$
Incidentally, this means that if $$r_2 = 2 \cdot r_1$$, the cost is the same as getting into (a lower) orbit.

# Okay, but what about getting into an orbit at some altitude?
