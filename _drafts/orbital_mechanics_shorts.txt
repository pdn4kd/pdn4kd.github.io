Horizontal vs vertical ascent/descent (horizontal is always better, if you can pull it off)

Most efficient capture orbit (general, and including circularization costs. With aside on how this also applies to escapes)

Sun brightness (Why Voyager 2 and New Horizons could photograph easily, 1 100 W lightbulb per drop tile analogy, and distances at which sun is as dim as moon, various planets, sirius, etc)

Efficient transfers (pretty much value of Oberth, but also Hohmann vs bielliptic)

Gravity assists - KSP style

Single stage performance, leading to:
Analytic solution to maximizing single stage performance/payload
Analytic(?) solution to splitting fuel between 2 different stages
