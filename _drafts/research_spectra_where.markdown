# What is RV info
We need features in spectra to even be able to spot a red/blue shift. So, absorption (or rarely emission) lines. In principle, the RV information in a given part of a spectrum is proportional to the slope of the spectrum there. More slope/features means more things that can be cross-correlated to find the radial velocity to greater precision.

# Temperature (and other things) vs RV info
More T means more light! (but at a varying range)
Lines available vary with temperature. In principle cooler is better (more lines), but it's complicated.

The lines in stellar atmospheres are also affected by rotation rates, surface gravity, and metallicity. A faster rotation rate spreads out the lines, reducing the precision of RV measurements. So does the higher pressure implied by higher surface gravity. Metallicity affects the number and depth of lines. As long as they are not saturated or blending together, more/deeper lines mean more precise radial velocity measurements.

# Temperature vs Wavelength
The brightest wavelength scales with $$\frac{1}{T}$$, but the typical range of stars spans only about a factor of 4 in temperature. The practical range is closer to a factor of 2, so any reasonably broad spectrograph can cover all of it.

# putting it all together
and now for some graphs
