What I'm doing (survey simulations):
Why?
	improve state of art in predictions
	find targets for space based direct imaging (include derivations of survey reqs)
How (RVs)?
	What/how spectra tell us
	existing papers I'm using
How (Surveys)?
	MINERVA history
	Considered parameters (telescopes, weather...)
	Dispatch scheduler - what to see next?

A UMKC wrapup:
What I did (ideas, code)
what I found (get old graphs)
Why it wasn't all that helpful (Schawinski vs Meert, and how my data was too small for the distributions, most galaxies are intermediate, etc.)

example posts?
Site selection: Dec and weather vs obs (also a bit about atmosphere?)
Atmospheric losses (also useful for amatures!)
RV single measurement precision and Beatty's spectrum model
Dispatch Scheduler (lots)
