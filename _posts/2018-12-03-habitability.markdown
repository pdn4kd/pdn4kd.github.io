# We don't [yet] know what makes a planet habitable
For the first half of the twentieth century, we had only a vague understanding of what made a planet in our solar system habitable. They were no longer mere points of of light, but the unkowns still dominated. Even as late as 1960, it was still reasonable to imagine Mars and Venus teeming with life. By 1975, our improved knowledge had shown that they were barren. (While there are still reasons to be hopeful about Venus' upper atmosphere and Mars' interior, any biomass would make the antarctic interior seem incredibly lush)

# More a speck of light than a world
For exoplanets, we are at best at a 1950s level of knowledge, and often not even 1890s. In those best cases we have sizes, masses, recieved starlight, and vague approximations of their atmospheres. Technically maps of reflection and [emission](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/multimedia/A-Knutson-surface.html) features exist, but these have resolutions worse than what [Hubble achieved](https://doi.org/10.1088%2F0004-6256%2F139%2F3%2F1128) [for Pluto](http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~buie/pluto/hrcmap.html), let alone the actually resolved features that [Lowell had for Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Giovanni_map_mars.jpg). In [some cases](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/aae5fb/meta) (eg: [K2-3d](https://doi.org/10.1051%2F0004-6361%2F201732459), [CoRoT-7b](https://doi.org/10.1051%2F0004-6361%2F201016059)), errors in mass and/or radius have resulted in large errors in densities. Even relatively modest errors (eg: TRAPPIST-1 over the past 2 years) can still change assumptions about atmospheres and compositions significantly. And all this ignores that for most planets, we don't even have both mass and radius!

We do have simulations, but with our limited data, they should be taken as possibilites rather than what those planets are actually like. And, well, they're simulations. As time goes on, they will become increasingly accurate, but it remains possible that we missed something. Compare present models of tide-locked planets with mid-late 20th century ones, where we though atmospheric collapse was inevitable, for instance.


A good general example of poorly known processes are clouds and hazes. We are still looking for patterns in the extent of clouds in hot jupiters, let alone in more difficult to study planets. A quick perusal of atmospheric studies circa 2014-2018 will also find an embarassing number of flat/featureless spectra because of possible clouds/hazes. But also for some targets we're fighting the limits of the instrumentation. Especially Spitzer, and its limited photometry (2 bands that are broad and yet relatively noisy).

A good specific example of poorly known processes is the hot super earth 55 Cancri e. We know that there is a non-trivial amount of heat transfer from its day to night side, but the observations and models have been contradictory. Initially there was reason to expect little to no atmosphere, and a dayside lava ocean. More recently, the possibility of an [earthlike (in terms of thickness though not composition)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03342) atmosphere has been raised. And the dayside temperature changes? [Volcanism](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fmnras%2Fstv2239). This world may be like Io, where we found evidence of vulcanism with ground based IR shortly before the Voyagers flew by. Unlike Io, we are not going to be able to image 55 Cnc e's surface in any detail any time soon, however. As such, resolving the atmosphere and lava (if any) will continue to be challenging.

# We also don't know where a planet is habitable
The ["Habitable Zone"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone) itself is an unfortunate piece of terminology, as it describes the locations where a planet *with the right atmosphere* can have liquid water at its surface. This is obviously influenced by how bright the star is, but more subtlely by the star's temperature, the planet's spin, and even the planet's tectonic activity. All of these are subject to change over the lifetime of a system, sometimes in ways we still poorly understand. And even if we do understand the general history of a star's habitable zone, there are details of feedback processes that we cannot yet observe.

Beyond the "habitable zone" proper, there are many places where there can still be liquid water (and therefore possibly life). The oceans of Europa, Enceladus, etc. remain unexplored. Perhaps supririsingly, the martian subsurface and upper atmosphere of Venus remain faint possibilities.

# Even if we find a habitable world, we might not recognize it
Our observations of the martian atmosphere don't completely rule out life, but [it must be quite rare.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08501). Ocean worlds (that is, ones with an extensive upper layer of water and no exposed land), [suffer from a lack of nutrients that is likely to hamper life.](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2017.1729) I don't know of any reason that this will stop hydrothermal vent communities, but those tend to be difficult to observe unless you are literally right on top of them. The situation is likely even worse if the bottm of the ocean is in contact with high pressure ice instead of rock, though that's more of a problem for something Earth-sized.

The net effect is that if worlds sufficiently unlike our own harbor life, it may be too hidden and/or sparse to be found anytime soon. By mass, [most life on earth is (land) plants, followed distantly by (crustal) bacteria and (oceanic) animals. In decending order of total mass, life is land based first, oceanic second, and crustal third.](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1711842115) One would hope that this order holds elsewhere, as it is also least to most detectable. Yet in outer solar system moons and exoplanets that are not extremely earthlike, this may also be the order from least to most habitable. 

# We don't know what we don't know
Basically, don't take the term "habitable zone" too literally. Our knowledge of these environments is poorly defined, and will be for a number of decades. Even in our 'backyards', mysteries remain. If you're writing hard science fiction set on alien worlds, you can largely go wild. And if you somehow solve one or more of these things so we can easily find life (or lack thereof), please tell me?

# Addenda 2024-05-15
We're now reasonably certain that [TRAPPIST-1 b is an airless rock](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023Natur.618...39G/abstract), [and 1 c](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023Natur.620..746Z/abstract) [is questionable](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...955L...7L/abstract). [The rest having significant atmospheres is also uncertain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16490), and [TRAPPIST-1 d is only potentially habitable in a narrow atmosphere and surface parameter space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00132).

[M-dwarf stellar activity is the culprit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17384), and drives a lot of these unknowns about their planets.

We're also deeply concerned about [abotic oxygen](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785L..20W/abstract) giving false impressions of life. And as a result a lot of studies are looking for combinations of gases, and talk about archean vs protozoic vs modern earth. [Retrevials can still be misleading, though!](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024PSJ.....5....7Y/abstract)

# Addendum 2025-08-04
L98-59 b [looks to have a volcanic atmosphere](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...980L..26B/abstract), so maybe something can be hung onto more easily. Though this is an M3V star (contrast with an M8V like TRAPPIST-1), so it's also less active.

# Adendum 2025-08-25:
[GJ 1132b is probably a bare rock, though a thin atmosphere is still possible](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10579). [TRAPPIST-1 d either doesn't have an atmosphere, or the possibilities are limited (though there's still more in the parameter space)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08416). [GJ 3929b is also probably a bare rock](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12516). [LTT 3890 b is definitely a bare rock](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14210). It's clear that while we don't fully understand the cosmic shoreline yet, a lot of M-dwarf planets are on the airless side.

Investigations on [exotic liquids as a medium for life continues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08437), though these are probably rare.

Our own [solar system architecture](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...810..105M/abstract) may be something of an outlier, which may suggest that life is rare. But it also might be unrelated. [We still have a number of conflicting formation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03453), which ties into that.
