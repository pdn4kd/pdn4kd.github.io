# A complete list of celestial bodies intentionally bombed by the United States of America (as of 2019-10-14)

| Date | Body | Mission | Comments|
| --- |:---:|:---:|:--- |
| 1962 | Moon | Ranger 4 | Spacecraft failed en-route |
| 1964 | Moon | Ranger 6 | Cameras failed |
| 1964 | Moon | Ranger 7 | First success of the Ranger Program |
| 1965 | Moon | Ranger 8 |  |
| 1965 | Moon | Ranger 9 | Final Ranger Mission |
| 1966 | Moon | Lunar Orbiter 1 | Somewhat ambiguous as to the intentionality |
| 1967 | Moon | Lunar Orbiter 2 |  |
| 1967 | Moon | Lunar Orbiter 3 |  |
| 1968 | Moon | Lunar Orbiter 5 |  |
| 1969 | Moon | Apollo 12 | LEM upper stage used to gather seismic data |
| 1969 | Moon | Apollo 13 | S-IVB used to gather seismic data |
| 1970 | Moon | Apollo 14 | Both S-IVB and LEM used to gather seismic data |
| 1971 | Moon | Apollo 15 | Both S-IVB and LEM used to gather seismic data |
| 1972 | Moon | Apollo 16 | S-IVB used to gather seismic data, control of LEM ascent stage lost, so impact site is unknwon |
| 1972 | Moon | Apollo 17 | Both S-IVB and LEM used to gather seismic data |
| 1994 | Venus | Magellan | Somewhat debatable as to if this should be here |
| 1999 | Moon | Lunar Prospector |  |
| 1999 | Mars | Deep Space 2 | No data recieved after impact |
| 2003 | Jupiter | Galileo | The 1995 atmospheric probe is not counted as it was supposed to slow down (and did) |
| 2005 | 9P/Tempel | Deep Impact | Flyby and impactor |
| 2009 | Moon | LCROSS | Both the spacecraft and its Centaur upper stage |
| 2012 | Moon | GRAIL | Two spacecraft (Ebb and FLow) |
| 2014 | Moon | LADEE |  |
| 2015 | Mercury | MESSENGER |  |
| 2017 | Saturn | Cassini | Grand Finale |

Notes: Many of these are end-of mission deorbitings. Earth is not included because this is intended to be funny, not depressing. Stages that acted in a "crasher" manner for landers (eg: heatshields, parachutes, sky-cranes) are also not counted, though stages crashed for seismic purposes or debris plumes are. Shoemaker-NEAR's hitting 433 Eros is considered a landing, and OSIRIS-REx's interactions with Bennu a touch-and-go.

# Other countries and unintentional bombings (incomplete)

| Date | Body | Mission | Comments|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:--- |
|1959|Moon|Luna 2|First human object to reach the moon, though actual data return had to wait for Luna 3. Both upper stage and spacecraft impacted|
|1965|Moon|Luna 5|Technically a Lander|
|1965|Moon|Luna 7|Technically a Lander|
|1965|Moon|Luna 7|Technically a Lander|
|1966|Moon|Surveyor 2|Technically a Lander|
|196x|Moon|Luna 10|Defunct as of 1966, fate unknown but has likely crashed by now|
|1966|Moon|Surveyor 4|Technically a Lander. May have exploded before impact|
|196x|Moon|Luna 11|Defunct as of 1966, fate unknown but has likely crashed by now|
|196x|Moon|Luna 12|Defunct as of 1967, fate unknown but has likely crashed by now|
|1967|Moon|Lunar Orbiter 4||
|19xx|Moon|Explorer 35|Turned off in 1967, orbit must have decayed, but exact crash date and location is unkown|
|196x|Moon|Luna 14|Defunct as of 1968, fate unknown but has likely crashed by now|
|1969|Moon|Apollo 10|LEM descent stage crash site unknown|
|1969|Moon|Luna 15|Sample Return, crashed on descent during Apollo 11 mission|
|1969|Moon|Apollo 11|We don't actually know where the LEM ascent stage went|
|1971|Moon|Luna 18|Sample Return, but crashed during descent|
|1972|Moon|Apollo 16 PFS-2|Subsatellite launched to measure lunar particles and fields. Helped to lead to the discovery of masscons|
|19xx|Moon|Apollo 15 PSF-1|Subsatellite launched to measure charged particles and magentic fields. Turned off in 1973, but probably crashed shortly thereafter due to masscons|
|19xx|Moon|Explorer 49|Turned off in 1977, orbit must have decayed, but exact crash date and location is unkown|
|1971|Mars 2 Lander|Orbiter was more successful|
|1973|Mars 6 Lander|Probably crashed|
|196x|Moon|Luna 22|Defunct as of 1975, fate unknown but has likely crashed by now|
|199x|Moon|Hagoromo|Probable crash, attempted to orbit in 1990|
|1992|Pioneer Venus|Orbit more or less decayed naturally|
|1993|Moon|Hiten||
|1999|Mars|Mars Climate Orbiter|The infamous unit messup|
|1999|Mars|Mars Polar Lander|RIP, "Faster, Cheaper, Better"|
|2005|25143 Itokawa|Hayabusa|Marginal sample collection|
|2006|Moon|SMART-1||
|2008|Moon|Moon Impact Probe|Launched alongside Chandrayaan-1|
|2009|Moon|Okina|Part of Kaguya mission|
|20xx|Moon|Ouna|Part of Kaguya mission, fate unclear. Likely to crash soon if it has not already|
|2009|Moon|Chang'e 1||
|2009|Moon|Kaguya||
|2016|Mars|Schiaparelli EDM lander|So close...|
|2019|Moon|Longjiang-2|Somewhat unclear when. Part of Chang'e 4|
|2019|162173 Ryugu|Hayabusa-2|Multiple strikes|
|2019|Moon|Beresheet|First for both Israel and a private company|
|2019|Moon|Vikram|Fairly low speed crash due to almost landing successfully|

Notes: Information on the fates of the ambiguous lunar orbiters (if it exists) would be greatly appreciated. No Martian orbiter is included, as it is unclear that any have yet crashed.
