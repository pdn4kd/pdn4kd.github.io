# "I want to do a fuel efficient landing, when should I fire my engine?"

The ideal case is of course that you arrive at (a perfectly smooth) airless body with a periapsis skimming the surface, and perform an impulsive burn. In reality, that's not happening.

But you can 0 your (horizontal) velocity at low altitude (make sure you're in surface mode), fall a bit, and then zero it out again right as you reach the surface.

# Derivation
The craft's descent is in 2 stages: a free-fall, and then a powered descent, reaching 0 velocity at the surface.

We start by making a bunch of simplifying assumptions:
 * You're in a non-rotating reference frame. (Most bodies are rotating slow enough that this is okay)
 * You're in a vacuum.
 * The body's gravity is constant / it's flat. (Good if your altitude changes little compared with its radius)
 * Your craft's mass doesn't change. (Iffy)

These let us apply one of the [kinematic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion#Uniform_acceleration): $$V_f^2 = V_i^2 + 2 a x$$

So the free-fall stage is: $$V^2 = 2 g x_1$$, where V is the velocity when you turn on your engines, g is the local gravity, and x_1 is the free-fall distance.

The powered descent stage is: $$0 = V^2 + 2 (g - \frac{F}{m}) x_2$$, where F is the craft's thrust, m is it's mass, and x_2 is the decelleration distance (which is conveniently the altitude at which the burn starts).

Isolating the V^2 and combinging: $$2 g \cdot x_1 = 2 (\frac{F}{m} - g) x_2$$

We don't care about $$x_1$$, so defining $$y = x_1 + x_2$$ ($$y$$ is your initial altitude): $$ 2 g (y - x_2) = 2 (\frac{F}{m} - g) x_2$$

Solving for $$x_2$$: $$g \cdot y - g \cdot x_2 = \frac{F}{m} x_2 - g \cdot x_2$$

$$ g \cdot y = \frac{F}{m} x_2$$

$$x_2 = \frac{y \cdot m}{F \cdot g}$$

Since (thrust/mass)/gravity is TWR, this is $$x_2 = \frac{y}{TWR}$$



# Application
In reality, you want to avoid smashing into the ground at excessive speed, so will err at stopping at <100 m and taking the last bit gently:

1. Take note of your TWR around the current body.
2. Zero out your velocity
3. Note your current (radar) altitude. Call it y.
4. Fall until you reach y/TWR.
5. Full throttle until you get to about 0 m altitude and 0 m/s. (whichever comes first)
6. Throttle down and enjoy your soft landing with minimum Î”v expendature.

# Example
![In Munar orbit](/images/screenshot137.png "A lander in Munar orbit. We're over the East Farside Crater.")
In Munar orbit.

![After zeroing velocity](/images/screenshot139.png "After Zeroing out velocity")
Velocity has been (basically) zeroed out. We're 12 km up (radar altitude, it's more like 14 above datum), at have a TWR of ~12, so the suicide burn will start 1 km up.

![Falling](/images/screenshot142.png "1 km up.")
Time to start the burn.

![Burn!](/images/screenshot143.png "Suicide burn in progress.")
This was rather scary.

![Final Descent](/images/screenshot144.png "Throttled down to almost nothing and descending the last few 10s of meters at around 8 m/s.")
Having zeroed out my horizontal velocity a bit ove the ground, I'm now doing a normal slow descent at a few m/s. Throttle is just about cancelling out the Mun's gravity.

![Landed!](/images/screenshot146.png "The lander is on the surface.")
And safely landed. The method works! Albeit somewhat inefficiently.

I expended 745 m/s, which suggests that there's room for improvement. In reality, the breakdown suggests that gravity losses were minimal. (541 m/s dropping from orbit, ~191 stopping the fall, and ~13 m/s on final descent) Any efficiency increase would require [a different method to minimize any sort of vertical drop](orb_horizontal_vs_vertical).
