Or, the Alpha Centauri system is the closest to Sol, but what's the closest to Alpha Centauri? This is also sort of "what does the night sky look like from a nearby star system?", though that can get very messy very quickly. (Hence my not dealing with RA&Dec. Also most of these objects are quite faint.)

Using [the 10 parsec sample](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/06/aa40985-21/aa40985-21.html), (raw data [available at CDS](https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/650/A201)) and converting the spherical coordinates into rectangular, and then doing offsets, I get:

The nearest stars and brown dwarfs to Alpha Cen A:

|Name|Distance (pc)|Type|
|-|-|-|
|Luhman 16|1.091|L7.5 + T0.5 (brown dwarfs)|
|Sol|1.346|G2V (yellow dwarf)|
|Barnard's Star|1.990|M3.5V (red dwarf)|
|WISEA J085510.74-071442.5|2.475|Y4 (brown dwarf)|
