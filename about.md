I am P N, a ~~graduate student~~ PhD candidate in Astronomy at George Mason University. I'm currently working on theoretical/simulation approaches to better finding exoplanets in radial velocity surveys. Less theoretically, I'm sometimes operating [the campus telescope](https://sites.google.com/view/georgemasonobservatory/) for tours/outreach as well as transit follow-up.

Also, I poke at random space and number crunching things for fun, so not *everything* will be work-related.

That said, I'll probably end up putting a resume/CV here, since this *is* a semi-profesional site, and those posts hopefully hilight my skills.

This site uses the base [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme / minima. I'll take suggestions on how to tweak things, though.
