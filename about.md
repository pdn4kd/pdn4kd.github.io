I am a ~~graduate student~~ PhD candidate in Astronomy at George Mason University. I'm currently working on theoretical/simulation approaches to better finding exoplanets in radial velocity surveys. Less theoretically, I'm sometimes operating [the campus telescope](https://sites.google.com/view/georgemasonobservatory/) for tours/outreach as well as transit follow-up.

Also, I poke at random space and number crunching things for fun, so not *everything* will be work-related.

This site uses the base [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme. Please be aware that the documentation may be missing major steps requiring you to google error messages/search stack overflow.
