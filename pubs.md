A hopefully complete listing of papers (etc) that I've been involved in.

# First-author Publications
[EPRV Sims Technical Report](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/internal_resources/1950) ([part of the NASA-NSF EPRV initiative](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/NNExplore/EPRV/)). A modified version that's an actual paper has been submitted.

# Relevant Co-author Publications
[EPRV Working Group Final Report](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210714291C/abstract) ([part of the NASA-NSF EPRV initiative](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/NNExplore/EPRV/)). My portion is (unsurprisingly) listed in more depth in the technical report.

["Faster Exo-Earth yield for HabEx and LUVOIR via extreme precision radial velocity prior knowledge"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JATIS...7b1220M), my simulations fed into section 2.4 / prior knowledge assumptions.

["TESS Delivers Five New Hot Giant Planets Orbiting Bright Stars from the Full-frame Images"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..194R/), a "Cargo-ship paper" in Joey Rodriguez's terms. (Admittedly this was just collecting data for TOI-1601 b. I probably count as an experienced operator for our 0.8 m telescope)

["EarthFinder Probe Mission Concept Study: Characterizing nearby stellar exoplanet systems with Earth-mass analogs for future direct imaging"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200613428P/abstract), since an orbital RV survey may work better(!) than the ground-based ones that have been my primary focus.

["The Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) Mission Concept Study Final Report"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200106683G/abstract), a mission like HabEx (or LUVOIR) is of course the mid-term goal for a lot of astronomers. A very large mission that could well give us photometry (and in some cases low resolution spectroscopy and even maps) of earth-like worlds.

["Joint Radial Velocity and Direct Imaging Planet Yield Calculations. I. Self-consistent Planet Populations"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893..122D/abstract), part of a hopefully ongoing collaboration with realistic exoplanets as targets for injection/recovery tests (since my code only does the surveys and a subset of noise sources. So we need actual planet signals...)


# Other
I'd certainly be willing to put up my old slides/posters up here, but I'm not sure there's any interest since it would be either undergrad work or covered by current/upcoming papers. At least some of the details of my work is going to end up as blog posts.

["A Flexible Python Observatory Automation Framework for the George Mason University Campus Telescope"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021tsc2.confE...8R/abstract), we're moving towards increasingly automating the campus telescope (see above on doing transit follow-up observations), and my contributions to research observing also fed into beta-testing the code and suggesting features/bug-fixes. I'm currently listing a conference abstract, though this is also becoming a paper.
