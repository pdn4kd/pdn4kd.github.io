A more or less complete listing of papers (etc) that I've been involved in.

## First-author Publications
[EPRV Sims Technical Report](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/internal_resources/1950) ([part of the NASA-NSF EPRV initiative](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/NNExplore/EPRV/)). A modified version that's an actual paper [has since been submitted and published.](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/acad07)

## Relevant Co-author Publications
# Survey Simulations
[EPRV Working Group Final Report](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210714291C/abstract) ([part of the NASA-NSF EPRV initiative](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/NNExplore/EPRV/)). My portion is (unsurprisingly) listed in more depth in the technical report.

["Faster Exo-Earth yield for HabEx and LUVOIR via extreme precision radial velocity prior knowledge"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JATIS...7b1220M), my simulations fed into section 2.4 / prior knowledge assumptions.

["EarthFinder Probe Mission Concept Study: Characterizing nearby stellar exoplanet systems with Earth-mass analogs for future direct imaging"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200613428P/abstract), since an orbital RV survey may work better(!) than the ground-based ones that have been my primary focus.

["The Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) Mission Concept Study Final Report"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200106683G/abstract), a mission like HabEx (or LUVOIR) is of course the mid-term goal for a lot of astronomers. A very large mission that could well give us photometry (and in some cases low resolution spectroscopy and even maps) of earth-like worlds.

["Joint Radial Velocity and Direct Imaging Planet Yield Calculations. I. Self-consistent Planet Populations"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893..122D/abstract), part of a hopefully ongoing collaboration with realistic exoplanets as targets for injection/recovery tests (since my code only does the surveys and a subset of noise sources. So we need actual planet signals...)

["Impact of Correlated Noise on the Mass Precision of Earth-analog Planets in Radial Velocity Surveys"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AJ....165...98L/abstract), or stellar noise *matters*. This paper uses the raw time series from my technical report/first paper, but consideres several sources of correlated noise (p-modes, granulation, and stellar activity). Luhn's conclusion is that these noise sources can potentially be sufficient to render my optimistic conclusions irrelevant, and make EPRV pathfinder missions of limited value. Better adressing stellar activity will be part of my followup work.

# Campus Telescope Operations / Transit Follow-up
["TESS Delivers Five New Hot Giant Planets Orbiting Bright Stars from the Full-frame Images"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..194R/), a "Cargo-ship paper" in Joey Rodriguez's terms. (Admittedly this was just collecting data for TOI-1601 b. I probably count as an experienced operator for our 0.8 m telescope)

["Another Shipment of Six Short-Period Giant Planets from TESS"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220505709R/abstract), a second "cargo-ship paper" with Joey Rodriguez as the lead author. In this case, my data collection was for TOI-2025 b.

["The TESS Grand Unified Hot Jupiter Survey. II. Twenty New Giant Planets"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15473), another large planet detection paper where I helped with data collection in the transit-followup role.

## Other
I'd certainly be willing to put up my old slides/[posters](/postersetc/) up here, but I'm not sure there's any interest since it would be either undergrad work or covered by current/upcoming papers. At least some of the details of my work is going to end up as blog posts.

["A Flexible Python Observatory Automation Framework for the George Mason University Campus Telescope"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021tsc2.confE...8R/abstract), we're moving towards increasingly automating the campus telescope (see above on doing transit follow-up observations), and my contributions to research observing also fed into beta-testing the code and suggesting features/bug-fixes. I'm currently listing a conference abstract, though this is also becoming a paper.

 ["Methods of Data Analysis on TESS Observations"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021tsc2.confE..10K/abstract), an example of the work we're doing with a pipeline of those observations and exoplanet follow-up. Hence why I can claim to eg: be a co-discoverer of TOI-1601 b.
